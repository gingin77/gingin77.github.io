# portfolio_site

This project holds all of the essential front-end code for my portfolio site and hosts an up-to-date version of the scatterplot project I designed using programming language data from GitHub's REST API to populate a scatterplot constructed using d3.js.

A lengthy description of the problem solving process I used for the scatterplot project is available on my blog, starting with this post: <a href='https://ginnielearnstocode.wordpress.com/2017/12/03/building-a-scatter-plot-with-d3-js-using-programming-language-data-from-githubs-rest-api/'>Building a scatter plot with d3.js using data from GitHubâ€™s REST API.</a>
